### Creating Our first-project on REACT (REACT FACTS)

#### Objective:
To create a beginner-friendly React application that showcases interesting facts about React.js using proper component structure and folder separation. This project aims to solidify foundational concepts of React, including reusable components, JSX, props, and modular coding practices.
